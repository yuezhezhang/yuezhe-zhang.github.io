Hey! This is Yuezhe Zhang 张越哲. 

I obtained my matster degree with honours in Robotics from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). I worked on my thesis in [Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab](https://www.autonomousrobots.nl/) and [AIRLab Delft](https://icai.ai/airlab-delft/), under the supervision of [Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JydqDdEAAAAJ&hl). Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree with honours in Mechatronics Engineering from [Xuteli School](https://xuteli.bit.edu.cn/english/index.htm), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the development of new integrated task and motion planning algorithms that combine fundamental concepts from optimization techniques with machine learning techniques, aiming at obtaining human-level adaptability and intelligence in real robot systems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
